# Todo-App-UnitTest
A simple SwiftUI To-Do app built using Clean Architecture and Core Data. The main goal is to write testable, modular Swift code with clear separation of concerns. Designed with Combine and the Coordinator pattern for unidirectional data flow. This project helps me practice writing unit tests effectively.
