# Todo-App-UnitTest
📝 ToDoList App
A simple SwiftUI-based To-Do app built with Clean Architecture, Combine, and Core Data. This project is designed not only to manage tasks efficiently, but also as a personal learning project focused on writing testable code with a clear separation of concerns.

🎯 Goal
The primary objective of this app is to practice writing clean, modular, and testable Swift code to facilitate proper unit testing. Every layer — from storage and data sources to use cases and view models — follows a unidirectional flow, enabling easier testing and maintenance.

🧱 Architecture
Domain Layer: Domain Models & Use Cases

Data Layer: Local Data Source & Repository & Dto Models

Presentation Layer: SwiftUI Views & ViewModels

Coordinator Pattern for navigation

🧪 Testing Ready
Designed with testability in mind — the use of protocols and dependency injection makes unit testing straightforward.
